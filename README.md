# Introduction

Hello, dear fellow students of GJU ,
I'm planning to release one of the user-scripts I've written that can help you automate the task of finding the optimal schedule with totally no effort . 

The script skims data from the University's database using their "Course sections" Interface and gets all possible combinations , filters them and scores them from best to worst . It allows you to get the Optimal Schedule laid out for you .
The script requires a wait time of 30*(subjects number) seconds to finish the whole process . 

Sadly , currently i've only allowed the usage of the script to analyze sections in the Madaba Departments of the University.


# Installation process : 
-Please install https://tampermonkey.net/ on your browser (preferably chrome) .

-Install the script from https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/33492-goblindh-omdano (By pressing on the green install button)

# Usage instructions :
-Just open Course sections normally , You'll find a new button named Custom Search next to the old Search button , click that .

-Enter Course IDs in the appropriate fields on the right .
-Select blocked next to each Course to include blocked sections in the search .

-If you have any favorite teachers , please enter their exact name as from the Course Sections search or from https://www.biblio-jo.com/staff-directory (Please discard the honorifics).

-If you'd like to setup a break at a certain time , please select the appropriate options at the drop-down menus .

-Click Start and stay on the page to minimize errors . 

-After the loading finishes and the courses get loaded , you can flip through the top 10 possibilities from the upper side of the table .
